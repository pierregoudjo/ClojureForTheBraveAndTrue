# Clojure For The Brave And True
This repository log my progress through [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) written by Daniel Higginbotham. It is a nice book about Clojure taking the reader through Vampires and Werewolves hunting and cheese thieves catching.

## Difference from the book
As the book was written before some recent development in the clojure world, some code might differ from the original. A non-exhaustive list of things that might differ are:

- Using deps.edn instead of leiningen. deps.edn are becoming the de-facto dependency management tool in the Clojure ecosystem. It is better to go with it
- Using Sublime text instead of Emacs. I really can't get my head around Emacs. I'll try maybe another time. Who knows? It could finally click. But at the moment I'll go with Sublime Text. I also tried Calva + VSCode but it feels too magical for me and the nREPL dependency was unnecessary.

## Credits
Clojure for the Brave and True is a book by Daniel Higginbotham published by No Starch Press. All the code in this repository come from this book with very slight alteration when necessary.
